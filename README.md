# rollup-template

Simple starter template for a rollup project.

Includes the [@rollup/plugin-node-resolve](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/node-resolve) plugin for including node modules in your bundle.

Running `npm start` with nodejs @16 installed will bundle [main.js](https://github.com/joewdavies/rollup-template/blob/main/main.js) and its imports into [dist/main.js](https://github.com/joewdavies/rollup-template/blob/main/dist/main.js) which is then imported by [index.html](https://github.com/joewdavies/rollup-template/blob/main/index.html).
